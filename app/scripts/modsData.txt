This interdisciplinary module explores the concept of domesticity “ how and where we live “ by examining its portrayals in architecture, art and film. It gives a broad and critical overview by working through a series of key contemporary architectural, art and film projects drawn from Asia, Europe and the United States.",

Besides investigating one or more such techniques, we will also investigate the main characteristics of the design space and its structure.",

This course will not only introduce the basic concepts and the nuts and bolts of investments but will also focus on real-time market analysis. Besides covering investment theory, the class will be required to apply the methodology into real life applications and translate these applications into actual portfolio strategies. These assignments will subsequently be channeled into an investment portfolio that the candidate will manage in a team environment. Participants will have to enroll into a stock market stimulation game with emphasis on the implementation of course study materials into market actions.",

The rate-based design concept is then extended to operations involving simultaneous heat and mass transfer such as in cooling tower and dryer. The process design principles are illustrated with distillation, absorption, extraction, adsorption, cooling tower and drying processes.",

Specifically, we study the Keynesian, New Keynesian, Neo Classical and Real Business Cycle models, and examine their different assumptions and policy prescriptions for macroeconomic stabilization. IS-LM and AD-AS frameworks are employed in studying some or all of these paradigms. Finally, we evaluate the predictions of these models against business cycle facts. We will also briefly review national income accounting and discuss some measurement issues.",

The module begins with ways of summarizing economic data, including the use of frequency distributions and measures of central tendency and dispersion. This is followed by an initiation into the concepts of classical probability, paving the way for the important topics of random variables and probability distributions. Next, the core ideas of classical statistical inference are introduced - including sampling distributions, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing and analysis of variance. Finally, correlation and regression analyses will be covered.",

It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. The module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101. It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework. After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games. Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.",

We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics. We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).",

It is not only a challenging mindset to inculcate in young budding engineers, but it is also a rich training ground to foster critical thinking skills which are pertinent to conceptualizing products that maximizes the value to customers. The objectives of this module is to expose students to frugal engineering through a field trip to the rural communities in the region to observe first-hand the way of life in such communities and to develop ideas of products which will bring benefit to a large segment of this community. Students will also engage with industries with a frugal engineering focus.",

It will explore environmental and economic policies and how best to resolve the tensions between conservation and development. It will study the setting up of effective administrative institutions, land use planning, the provision of environmental infrastructure (modern sanitation, water treatment plants, transport systems, etc). It will then critically examine the workings of the main administrative agencies that are responsible for environmental management in Singapore. It will also look into the work of local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as multi-national corporations and corporate social responsibility in Singapore.

		"ModuleDescription": "The title of this seminar is \"The Five S's of Molecules\" We live in a molecular world, when many current science subjects seem to gravitate towards molecules. Examples are plentiful, such as \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular Genetics\", \"Molecular Electronics\", \"Molecular Medicine\", \"Molecular Informatics\", \"Molecular Engineering\", \"Molecular Pharmacology\", \"Molecular Ecology\", \"Molecular Machines\"... etc. In the \"Science of Molecules\" viz. \"Chemistry\", the focus is on molecular design, molecular structure, molecular synthesis, molecular activity and molecular function. The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design. Molecular structures therefore are the fundamentals in molecular science. In this seminar series, we shall discuss with the class the underlying principles of chemical structures, with specific focus on the interrelationship among the five S's of molecules -Science, Structure, Stability, Symmetry, and, Space. The mode of teaching and learning focuses on group learning, interaction, independent enquiry, project work, molecular models, and public presentations. Writing and presentations are essential elements in this freshmen seminar. There will also be hands-on sessions on molecular models and molecular origami.

		"ModuleDescription": "The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to the roles of randomness in scientific thinking. Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren™t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?",

Very often misleading claims in science and in society more generally can arise from an ignorance of basic statistical ideas, but statistical methods can also be abused knowingly in fraudulent behaviour. On the other hand, statistical methods are also commonly used to detect and uncover fraud and dishonesty. After first looking at different kinds of deception involving data and the motivations for it this seminar will discuss the role of statistics in uncovering deception in areas such as: 1. Misleading claims in health; 2. Misleading surveys and opinion polls; 3. Claims and counterclaims in environmental science; 4. Fraud detection in the financial world; 5. Authorship disputes and detecting plagiarism It is intended that students gain an appreciation for basic statistical ideas for handling uncertainty as a key part of good scientific practice and decision making in society broadly.",

		"ModuleDescription": "The development of mathematical concepts and theories is often influenced by an intuition acquired from physical experience and by analogy with various areas of scientific and mathematical knowledge. Analogy is an important factor in preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition can sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to present case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the ground-breaking importance of \"counter-intuition\" in modern mathematics. A wealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis, algebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this module are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the internet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on the spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery. To illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some elementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and discussion. The main prerequisite for this module is an inquiring mind open to new ideas.

Structures and electronic and magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. To understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance spectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray absorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray photoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. We will also introduce scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future? This module is targeted at students from different faculties who are interested in learning some general knowledge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.",

The term bioorthogonal chemistry refers to some of these chemical reactions that can occur inside living systems without interfering with native biochemical processes. Since its introduction, the concept of the bioorthogonal reaction has enabled the study of many types of biomolecules under native cellular environments. In recent years, it has been expanded to many other fields, materials, nanotechnology and engineering. This seminar is intended for junior undergraduates who are interested in equipping themselves with a few very basic but essential set of organic reactions which are most relevant to non-specialists. The module will be conducted in the form of seminar discussion and presentations in a highly interactive manner. Both students and the professor will learn hand-in-hand about the subject of interest, and the students will be required to participate actively in twoway discussion. By using key examples in bioorthogonal chemistry developed in the last decade, the students will focus on interactive learning in unconventional ways (reading, literature search, group discussion, independent studies, presentation, etc). The professor will mostly serve as the facilitator (not feeder) of the learning process.",

The module begins by considering the nature and methods of physical geography. Building on examples from a number of sub-disciplines of physical geography, it considers issues of scientific explanation, measurement, sampling and modelling. Students taking the module will be able to reflect on the experimental design of their own research projects. Discussions about the methods of physical geography research highlight its relationship with the broader physical sciences and with the social-scientific context of geography. This provides a rich debate about the future path of physical geography and the responsibilities of its practitioners. Some commentators argue for a geographical tradition that places physical geography addressing the interface between the natural and human environments. Others see the practice of physical geographers to be dictated by the agenda of big science and for a role within an interdisciplinary scientific framework. The module will explore and debate these tensions in the changing nature of the discipline.",

Structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). Such structures exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future? This module is targeted at students from different faculties who are interested in learning some general knowledge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.",

No longer is human influence on the planet confined to the local environment, but now extends across political boundaries - often resulting in regional or even global impacts. As a result, society, industry and agriculture are under increasing pressure to improve environmental performance and cut resource consumption and pollution. Around the world, governments are striving to minimise waste production, protect water resources, reduce energy consumption and improve the quality of the urban living environment. As the human global population grows exponentially and the life-support systems of the planet continue to deteriorate, there is a growing international recognition that environmental problems require truly global solutions. This course will focus on the issues and causes of global environmental issues including: population growth, resource exploitation and threats to the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. The aim of the course will be to provide students with a knowledge and appreciation of the inter-related problems and challenges of sustainable development.",

It is intriguing to see the methods of computations in ancient Babylonian, Greek and Roman times, and in Chinese and Arabic cultures. For the modern digital era, we discuss how computer does calculations, how the instructions or algorithm are given to computer, and why the binary number system is used. Finally, we speculate the role quantum computer will play in the future.",

This course will introduce students to: (1) Various phenomena/features related to the oceans, such as tsunamis, thermohalines, tides, currents, storms, marine life and bioluminescence etc.. (2) How the oceans affect our lives (e.g. weather, climate, sources of food, travel etc) , (3) Our attempts at understanding the workings of the oceans using exploration and the scientific theories that have been developed over the last few decades. (4) Our attempts at controlling and exploiting the oceans (e.g. conservation, energy, marine engineering). Students will gain an appreciation of the scientific principles involved with the minimum of mathematics. This course will also prepare studnets to better understand the role of oceans, and provide insight into making educated decisions regarding our vulnerable environment and our precious supply of water.",

Public understanding of Darwin and evolution remains a serious problem. What most people think they know about Darwin, his life and his famous book ˜On the origin of species™ is wrong. This module, requiring no background in biology or science history, will provide a solid background for understanding how the history of the theory of evolution actually unfolded. The course covers the history of geology, paleaontology and biology from the 1700s to the 20th century. The central focus is on the life and work of Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and how biological evolution was uncovered and accepted by the international scientific community in the 19th century, and beyond. There are case studies on how to assess historical claims and evidence. The final 3 or 4 lectures discuss recent developments in evolutionary biology.",

Indeed, the new China has been premised upon revolutionary remaking and a total break from the past. Nonetheless, there are still historical continuities when compared with the previous imperial and republican eras. This module aims to provide a deeper understanding of contemporary China by looking at its politics, society, economy and culture in broad historical perspective and within a thematic framework. It also explores China™s distancing and connecting with the rest of the world.",

Three areas covered are: Advanced Surfacing, Parametric & Generative CAD Modelling, and Digital Manufacturing. Advanced Surfacing covers principles and methods to craft high precision, manufacturing-quality CAD models with complex, continuous organic surfaces that are water-tight. Parametric & Generative CAD teaches programming and algorithm-scripting-based methods to digitally generate and control 3D geometry. Digital Manufacturing introduces methods to translate 3D data to produce physical objects via digital manufacturing equipment. Students are expected to gain an operationally-ready level of mastery through hands-on experimentation in projects for all three areas.",

The irreplaceable values that natural primary forests have will be emphasized. The case of the need to extend these forests by recreating them in the urban context will be discussed. The appropriate use of non-indigenous plants will also be covered. The need to be ecological-minded when selecting plants will be emphasized with particular attention being placed on conservation; the beautification of place should not be done at the expense of making another landscape look less attractive. Lectures will be augmented with field trips which serve illustrate the application of the principles discussed to the ground. The business implications to matching the right plant to site, using quality plants and then being able to care for them professionally will be covered.",

In Legal Writing 2, we will focus on developing persuasive communication skills. Students will learn to: (i) formulate cogent arguments for their clients' positions; and (ii) convincingly present legal support for such positions. They will be expected to exercise these persuasive skills in multiple media (written, oral) and contexts (in simulated negotiations and courtroom presentations). These exercises will culminate in a hypothetical case or \"moot\" problem. Research assignments will cover statutoryand factual research.",

		"ModuleTitle": "Carriage of Goods by Sea",
		"Department": "LAW",
		"ModuleDescription": "This course will consider the legal regime which applies to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea. The carriage of goods by sea forms an important component of a wider body of law which is called maritime (or shipping) law. The subject matter of this course also forms a part of the (private) law of international trade and will assist those students studying international sales of goods and bank payment mechanisms in international trade, and insurance and marine insurance. All these subjects are invaluable to anyone who aspires eventually to work in shipping or international trade, whether as a lawyer in a law firm, as a legal adviser in-house, in insurance in a P & I Club, or for a marine insurer. Carriage of Goods by Sea is a core area of shipping law. The principal purpose which underlines this course is the carriage of cargo from one destination to another for profit. The seller/owner of goods who wishes to export them will hire a ship (particularly in the case of bulk commodities, such as oil) or space on a ship, depending on the quantity and type of goods to be transported. This course is therefore concerned with examining the legal relationships which arise between the shipper (or owner of the goods), the carrier (the shipowner), the charterer, and the receiver/consignee of the goods. The particular emphasis will be the principal documents of carriage, such as bills of lading, sea waybills and ship™s delivery orders, and the domestic legislation which governs these documents and also gives effect to international conventions. The coverage of international conventions will include the Rotterdam Rules, even though these Rules are not yet in force. A study will also be made of charterparties, specifically, voyage charters and time charters.",

In the first part of the course, the student will be introduced to basic ideas in classical anthropology and the sociology of law. Questions such as - Are there any ˜universal™ patterns of human behaviour? To what extent is a society™s perception of law influenced or controlled by environmental and econological factors? How are disputes resolved? Is aggression and warfare inherent in the human condition? - will be dealt with. In the second part of the course, these anthropological methods will be applied to a study of the concept of law in diverse societies from a sociological perspective, and to the actual function of law in society. Do patterns of human behaviour discernable in primitive societies hold true in more complex ˜modern™ societies? What are the attributes of a ˜modern™ legal system? Is the concept of ˜law™ in the western sense inevitable and universal in all kinds of societies. What happens to the concept of law in plural societies? Teaching will be by seminars which will include lectures and discussion of assigned readings. No previous knowledge of law anthropology or sociology is required or will be assumed of students.",

At the point of needing a theoretical underpinning for the novel concerns of academic law occasioned by globalization, fresh considerations of interdisciplinary perspectives on law are opened up, questioning the extent to which a distinctively legal approach to global issues is possible. This course engages with these challenges by exploring the global interconnectedness of law, morality, politics and economics, and considers what contribution legal theory might make to illuminating complex policy issues with a global reach.",

Since neurons and muscle tissues require a relatively constant extracellular environment for them to function properly, the important concept of homeostasis will be discussed. Emphasis will be on extracellular fluid volume and composition. In addition, mechanisms involved in the balance of heat gain and heat loss to maintain a constant body temperature will be covered.",

This module hopes to offer students clues to what are the fundamental ways in which basic biological structures and functions of living systems are actively modified to allow organisms to exploit the full range of natural environments and to maintain the radically different modes of life we see in nature. Efforts will be made to teach how environmental physiology can be applied to biomedicine, agriculture, ecology and environmental conservation in the last part of the module.",

We formulate linear programming (LP) problems and solve them by the simplex method (algorithm). We also look at the geometrical aspect and develop the mathematical theory of the simplex method. We further study problems which may be formulated using graphs and networks. These optimization problems can be solved by using linear or integer programming approaches. However, due to its graphical structure, it is easier to handle these problems by using network algorithmic approaches. Applications of LP and network optimization will be demonstrated. This course should help the student in developing confidence in solving many similar problems in daily life that require much computing. Major topics: Introduction to LP: solving 2-variable LP via graphical methods. Geometry of LP: polyhedron, extreme points, existence of optimal solution at extreme point. Development of simplex method: basic solution, reduced costs and optimality condition, iterative steps in a simplex method, 2-phase method and Big-M method. Duality: dual LP, duality theory, dual simplex method. Sensitivity Analysis. Network optimization problems: minimal spanning tree problems, shortest path problems, maximal flow problems, minimum cost flow problems, salesman problems and postman problems.",

In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing. (ii) To have the student gain perspective and practice in applying these skills through a research project. (iii) To develop an understanding of decision making in marketing, its inherent difficulties and pitfalls and the importance of information in marketing research.",

Students will learn to aurally identify musical characteristics of a range of styles and acquire the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary for their own critical appraisal of, and independent research into the repertoire that they listen to and play.",

Intertextual works are considered from analytical, contextual, reception-based, and philosophical perspectives - a holistic approach that introduces advanced methods and means of interpreting music. Assessment is research and essayoriented and the subject focuses on the development of advanced skills in these areas.",

The properties of basic electrical circuits comprising resistors, inductors and capacitors are discussed, along with analysis of their transient and steady-state behaviour. Understanding the role of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism is emphasized; b) Waves, introducing properties of waves, including geometric optics, propagation, interference and diffraction, and electromagnetic waves; and c) Quantum physics, where new physics concepts which led to the quantization of energy are introduced, leading to an explanation of atomic transitions, atomic spectra and the physical and the chemical properties of the atom. The uncertainty principle, wave-mechanics and wave particle duality concepts are covered, together with the use of wavefunctions in predicting the behaviour of trapped particles.

Different conceptions bear differently on the further question of what we should value and why. Discussion is both argument-driven and historically informed.",

The prototype code might be eventually thrown away, or could form the basis for constructing a component of the final product. Using prototypes, developers can obtain valuable feedback from the users early in the project lifecycle and can assess whether the software architecture can support demanding technical requirements. Prototypes also allow managers to assess the feasibility of estimates and whether the deadlines proposed can be successfully met. This course presents a software prototyping framework and how it might be supported directly by the Python programming language.",

The intermingling of people, the exchange of ideas and international commerce have been part of Southeast Asian life for centuries. This module surveys the broad currents of conflict, change and continuity across the region from a multidisciplinary perspective. It looks at how Southeast Asian societies and political systems have changed over time in response to the pressures of ecology, colonialism, nationalism, urbanization and globalization. The module also looks at the way ethnic, religious, national and regional identities have been constructed, used and altered over time. The overall objective is to provide students with an introduction to different ways of exploring Southeast Asia and different experiences of living in the region.",

Specific case studies are drawn on to allow a closer understanding of the way Chinese businesses were established and how they developed. The social, economic and cultural aspects closely associated with the Chinese business community of Singapore, such as early Chinese migration, dialect organisations, guilds, occupational structure, Chinese merchant culture, as well as the transformation and globalisation of Chinese businesses will also be discussed.

The new commitment of the co-habitation of nature and built environment has drawn attentions of the architects, urban designers and environmental professionals. The discourses of urban sustainability have to move away from social sufficiency, ecological efficiency to ecosystem compatibility by linking the forms and flows of urban, industrial and natural systems. The new challenges of urban ecological issue require design and environmental professionals to deal with how urban and environment spaces could be analyzed, designed, managed, evaluated, represented and changed for responding to the cutting-edge sustainable issues. Divided by two main categories, Spatial Typologies and Ecological Flows, the series of lecture covers the trends and issues of sustainable urban design and development. Following the introductory lecture based on planning and design history, the Part One Spatial Typologies includes global ecological effects of mega urban form, suburbanization and propositions of sustainable city, downtown urban design, waterfront revitalization and brown field redevelopment. The Part Two Ecological Flows covers the ecological design issues of landscape ecological flow, material and energy flow, water flow and informational flow. The sessions conclude with the discussion of representational dimension of urban and environmental design that is essential to the professional practices of ecologically sound urban and environmental design. By selecting one of the specific sustainable urban issues, students are required to work on a research project, which is to be presented as a team work during the semester and further developed as an individual term paper at the end of semester.",

Yet, the theory of evolution is more controversial and opposed by more forces in society than any other theory in science. The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\").",

Students will begin with the Aristotelian tradition and read contemporary treatments of the issues.

Are they speculation or fact? How do we know? Of what use are they? How have they shaped our lives? In this module we will retrace the key ideas that led Einstein to his formulation of the Special Theory of Relativity, and how the concepts evolved through various personalities to produce the elegant spacetime version of the theory, culminating in the General Theory of Relativity. Along the way we will see the practical application of the scientific method and clarify common misconceptions of the theory. We will also study the impact Relativity has had on science, technology, philosophy and culture, and have a peek at the research frontier, where gravity and quantum theory meet, to be aware of open problems. Synopsis Einstein™s insight was that time must be relative, in contrast to Newton™s assumption of an absolute time. Time dilation (moving clocks run slow) is easily derived from Einstein™s postulates and it immediately implies a range of related effects such as the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction. These phenomena are seen to be interconnected through the formulation of a Minkowskian spacetime, which unites, and generalizes, Euclid™s space with Newton™s time. A further generalization leads to the General Theory of Relativity which shows gravity to be an effect of a dynamical curved spacetime, the framework for cosmology.",

So what actually is creative thinking, can we foster it or is it just a matter of inspiration? We will analyze different forms of creativity with examples from history, research, technology and the arts. Then we will practice creative thinking and explore strategies how to manage innovative teams. To show that creative strategic thinking plays a role in various domains of society we turn towards negotiation and deal-making.We conclude with ideas how to communicate new ideas best and a discussion on creative leadership.",

At once celebrated and contested, Singapore™s multiculturalism is imbued with various themes and meanings, and poses many important issues and challenges central to personal, group and national cultural identities as well as to political, economic and social life. How did it come to be a core principle in nation-building? What are state imperatives and social processes and state imperatives in its historical making and constant remaking? Why are race, language and religion its core constitutive elements and how have their saliency evolved over time? What are its main controversial features and areas of tensions, and how do these affect identities, social relations between individuals, groups and communities, and impact social cohesion, citizenship and belonging? How is it further impacted by massive immigration? Is its present official form still valid in light of immigration, changing demographics and competing claims of rights and responsibilities? What does multiculturalism mean in citizens™ memories of the past, experiences in their present everyday lives, and imaginings of the future? This module explores and discusses these central questions and significant dimensions, issues and problems in Singapore™s contested multiculturalism through a combination of lectures, seminars, on-site learning, research projects, class presentations and personal reflections.

For Singapore, this question has been a key feature of its nation-building process since 1965 and its response has been the cultivation of an ostensibly ˜Asian™ multiculturalism styled in contradistinction to ˜Western™ liberal models. This module examines and evaluates the conceptual framework of the Singaporean model of multiculturalism. It does so by positioning it in relation to other existing theories of ethnocultural identity and rights. In so doing, it asks: 1. What are the theoretical and normative underpinnings of the Singaporean model? 2. How does it stand up against the liberal-democratic model? 3. What might be its differences between both the ˜Western™ communitarian and ˜Confucian™ communitarian models of multiculturalism? 4. Does it adequately account for the complexities of identity? 5. Can, given a changing ethnic and cultural demography, the Singaporean model survive?",

It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given.
